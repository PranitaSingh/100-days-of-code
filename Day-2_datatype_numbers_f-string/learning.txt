we are going to focus on 
- datatype 
- numbers
- operations
- type conversion
- f-string

#Data type - print 1st character of data-type
print("HELLO"[0])

#Integar
print(123+4567)

123,5,00 == 123_5_00      #specially in UK and US , is replaced by _  

#to add any data type 1st we need to define the type of data for example 
#If we have a int data type store in variable then we have to define it .

first_name=4
second_num = 5
print(int(first_name)+int(second_num))

#we cant concatinate the int type data type with strings 1st we need to convert it into string then we can concatinate.
==============================
#Example
print("the two digit are"+str(first_name) + str(second_num)")
